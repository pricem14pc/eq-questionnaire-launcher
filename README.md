# EQ Launcher

This project was copied from https://github.com/ONSdigital/go-launch-a-survey and should be used for v3 of runner.

### Building and Running
Install Go and ensure that your `GOPATH` env variable is set (usually it's `~/go`).

```
go get
go build
./eq-questionnaire-launcher

go run launch.go (Does both the build and run cmd above)
```

Open http://localhost:8000/

### Docker
The dockerfile is a multistage dockerfile which can be built using:

```
docker build -t eq-questionnaire-launcher:latest .
```

You can then run the image using `SURVEY_RUNNER_SCHEMA_URL` to point it at an instance of survey runner.

```
docker run -e SURVEY_RUNNER_SCHEMA_URL=http://localhost:5000 -it -p 8000:8000 onsdigital/eq-questionnaire-launcher:latest
```

The syntax for this will be slightly different on Mac

```
docker run -e SURVEY_RUNNER_SCHEMA_URL=http://host.docker.internal:5000 -it -p 8000:8000 onsdigital/eq-questionnaire-launcher:latest
```

You should then be able to access go launcher at `localhost:8000`

You can also run a Survey Register for launcher to load Schemas from

```
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 onsdigital/eq-survey-register:simple-rest-api
```

### Run Quick-Launch
If the schema specifies a `schema_name` field, that will be used as the schema_name claim. If not, the filename from the URL (before `.`) will be used.

Run Questionnaire Launcher
```
scripts/run_app.sh
```
Now run Go launcher and navigate to "http://localhost:8000/quick-launch?url=" passing the url of the JSON
```
e.g."http://localhost:8000/quick-launch?url=http://localhost:7777/1_0001.json"
```
